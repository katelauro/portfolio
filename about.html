    <p>
      I'm Kate Lauro, a computer science and journalism student at Northeastern
      University. Through my coursework and career experience, I have pursued
      projects that explore social justice issues through data analysis and
      visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have found ways intersect these interests in my coursework,
      extracurriculars and professional life. For example, my minor in food
      systems sustainability, health and equity has informed my understanding of
      environmentalism, food systems and ethics. My experience co-oping at the
      UN Population Fund helped me understand how data gathering and analysis
      can play a role in the distribution of sex education and reproductive
      healthcare. In a data visualization course that incorporated service
      learning, I was able to do community service and enhance my data
      visualization skills at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to seeking out a career where I can utilize and build upon
      my technical skills and continuing to follow my passions.
