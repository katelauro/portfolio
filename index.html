  <p>I am an aspiring information professional with a diverse array of career experiences and an educational background
    in both sciences and humanities which has fostered an ability to analyze real-world problems by gathering
    informational resources and contextualizing them in a universally understandable way.
  </p>
  <p>I have worked in retail, nonprofit, and IT sales consulting spaces which has fostered an ability to apply
    logistical
    skills and exhibit peer leadership in a variety of
    teams and environments.</p>
  <b>Currently pursuing a Master of Information Studies at McGill University and looking forward advancing my career
    through the continuous development of information sciences skills and practices.</b>
